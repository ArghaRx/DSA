Question :- 

N = 4
For level 1, we have 1 node.
For level 2, we have 2 nodes.
For level 3, we have 4 nodes
For level 4, we have 8 nodes
Output = 8, as level 4 has maximum 8 nodes.


public class Solution {
    public static int numberOfNodes(int N){
        // Write your code here.\\

         return (int)Math.pow(2, N-1);
// This line calculates and returns the result of 2 raised to the power of (N-1). The Math.pow function is used to calculate the power, and the result is cast to an integer using (int).

    }
}
